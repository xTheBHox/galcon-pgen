# galcon-pgen

Welcome to GALCON PGEN (short for Galactic Conquest Procedural Generation), a real-time strategy game involving up to 6 players.

To play, run gameClient.py. RUN WITH PYTHON 3.5 OR LATER!!!

Please install pygame ( http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml ) before running. Version 1.9 should suffice.
In any case, the app was built on pygame 1.9.2b1.

Also install numpy ( http://www.scipy.org/install.html ). (Note: This app runs on numpy 1.11.2, but later versions ought to be backward compatible.)
